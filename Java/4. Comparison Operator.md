# Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values or expressions. They always return a boolean result (true or false). These operators are fundamental for decision-making in programming.

## Equal To ==
```java
int x = 5;
int y = 5;
boolean result = (x == y);    // true - values are equal
```

## Not Equal To !=
```java
int x = 5;
int y = 3;
boolean result = (x != y);    // true - values are not equal
```

## Greater Than >
```java
int x = 5;
int y = 3;
boolean result = (x > y);     // true - x is greater than y
```

## Less Than <
```java
int x = 5;
int y = 3;
boolean result = (x < y);     // false - x is not less than y
```

## Greater Than or Equal To >=
```java
int x = 5;
int y = 5;
boolean result = (x >= y);    // true - x is greater than or equal to y
```

## Less Than or Equal To <=
```java
int x = 5;
int y = 5;
boolean result = (x <= y);    // true - x is less than or equal to y
```

## String Comparison
```java
// DON'T use == for Strings
String str1 = "Hello";
String str2 = "Hello";
boolean result1 = (str1 == str2);         // Unreliable!

// DO use .equals() for Strings
boolean result2 = str1.equals(str2);      // Correct way
```
## Why Use .equals() Instead of == for Strings?
- `==` compares memory addresses (checks if both variables point to exact same location in memory)
- `.equals()` compares the actual content/value of the objects
- Strings are objects in Java, not primitive types like int or boolean

## Quick Reference Table

| Operator | Name | Example | Result when True |
|----------|------|---------|------------------|
| == | Equal to | x == y | Values are equal |
| != | Not equal to | x != y | Values are different |
| > | Greater than | x > y | Left is greater |
| < | Less than | x < y | Right is greater |
| >= | Greater than or equal to | x >= y | Left is greater or equal |
| <= | Less than or equal to | x <= y | Right is greater or equal |
